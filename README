# libmydvb

libmydvb is a library for tuning and decoding data from Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) 
devices that supports the Linux Digital TV API (aka Linux DVB Api).
It is event based, so any program that uses
libmydvb only declare callbacks that the library will invoke when an event occurs while decoding 
the DVB stream

## Uses
libmydvb can be used in applications that want to receive information from MPEG-TS streams, like
EPG, MHP or HBBO. It can be use also to record channels (services) from Digital TV (PVR) or send them
 over internet (in local area networks in unicast or multicast)

libmydvb allows scanning of DTV networks and supports multiple frontend devices

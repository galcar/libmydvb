You need the following:

- linux experience

- C knowledge

- patience

- understatement how DVB works (to get the correct CWs from the ECMs)

- a DVB card supported by the drivers from http://linuxtv.org
  that gives you the unmodified TS (e.g. WinTV Nova)
  start the tsfeed on the machine containing the card
  you need the linuxtv-includes (URL see above) for compiling
  tsfeed doesn't tune - you have to do that yourself

- a fast linux-PC (>800MHz) to run the descrambler on
  start the descrambler here (may be same machine as above if fast enough)

- a source for decrypted ControlWords
  send them via TCP connection as 16byte packets to port 2049
  of the descrambler

compile:
gcc -Wall -O3 -I ~/DVB/ost/include -o tsfeed tsfeed.c
gcc -Wall -O3 descramble descramble.c csa.c

usage:
the descrambler will write the (decrypted if possible, but not verified)
output to stdout. you may use ts2ps from the linuxtv mpegtools 
to convert it into a format mplayer understands

limitations:
only descrambles pids crypted with the same ControlWord

Have fun!
